Built a calendar application using React and Material UI. This app will have features like dynamic event creation, todo list integration, and event color-coding. It's a great example of how to add complex functionalities to a React app. I used libraries like Material UI components, React Big Calendar, and date-fns for localized date formats.

## Key Features

### Event Management

- Users can add, view, and manage events on the calendar.
- Supports both slot-based and date-based event creation.

### Todo List Integration

- Shows how to add a todo list to a calendar application.
- Lets us to create todos and link them to events.

### Event Color-Coding

- Demonstrates how to color-code events dynamically based on associated todos or other criteria.

### React Big Calendar

- Uses the React Big Calendar library for main calendar functionalities.

### Locale Support

- Provides localized date formatting with the date-fns library.
